I use AI tools almost every day for learning, coding, and solving problems. ChatGPT is the most important tool for me because it helps with writing code, fixing errors, understanding concepts, and improving my English. Code-based AI tools also save time by suggesting code and reducing small mistakes. What fascinates me most about AI is how it increases human productivity and acts like a personal teacher. In the future, AI has great potential to help people build better solutions faster and focus more on creativity and ideas.
